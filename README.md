# EB Bars - It's a Super Simple Barplot Library ðŸ¦€

Simple barchart library for Rust with a focus on customizing the chart to look nice.

### So Simple that
- you can _only_ create barcharts and or histograms.
- there are no external dependencies.
- the only supported output is svg.
- all bars are drawn with the "rect" svg element instead of for example the "path" element.
- even your mom can use the API.

### But despite being simple you can customize your barchart by
- adding text in any of the four sides if you want.
- setting font size for text.
- applying custom colors on bars, lines, ticks/markers and text.
- showing or hiding grid lines (both horizontal and vertical).
- having bars with negative values be drawn downwards.
- setting a custom resolution.
- resizing the plot/figure and move it in all directions for best fit.
