# EB Bars - It's a Super Simple Barplot Library ðŸ¦€

Simple plotting library for Rust.

### So Simple that
- you can _only_ create barcharts and or histograms.
- there are no external dependencies.
- the only supported output is svg.
- all bars are drawn with the "rect" svg element instead of for example the "path" element.
- even your mom can use the API.

### But despite being simple, you can
- add text on one of or all four sides if you want.
- set font size for text.
- set custom colors on bars, lines, ticks/markers and text.
- show or hide grid lines.
- have negative valued bars point downwards.
- resize the plot/figure and move it in all directions for best fit inside the svg.
